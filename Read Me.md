This compendium for Jiujitsu is meant to help organize and visualize all the different techniques.

I am mainly a No-gi grappler, so all of these techniques are focused around No-gi techniques. That's why I didn't include things like lasso guard or spider guard: maybe down the future, it will have Gi things incorporated into here.

As of 3/19/2024, these notes are completely unfinished and unpolished. I would like to "complete" these one day and make it a presentable compendium, but I have a feeling it will be a long time before I do. If anyone wants to take this structure and build something better from it, I encourage you to do so!

The original intent for this guide was to help me map together a lot of ideas and positions together for me to understand Jiujitsu to a deeper level. **In NO WAY am I an expert in Jiujitsu**, most of these notes are compilations of ideas that I've been taught and seen in my classes and in videos from various professors and teachers. 

I want these notes to help anyone on their own journey at least get started to help navigate through positions, or help them create a gameplan that would work best for them.

I do not mean to disappoint everyone with an incomplete set of notes, but I hope this can be useful to anyone who installs it themselves. I want to release it for anyone who wants to take these into their own hands and add to it, or to even tailor for themselves. Please use these notes however you would like.

If you have any questions on Obsidian or learning Obsidian, there are countless guides and resources online to help you with the language and connections you can make on this amazing app.

If you have any questions about these notes at all or want to contact me, you can email me at yosu8376@gmail.com and I'll try to get back to you.

Thank you!
-Yo Han
