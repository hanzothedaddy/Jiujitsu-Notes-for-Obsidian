Escaping North South can be a bit tricky, and it often involves one to get themselves into the turtle position and [[Escaping the Turtle]].

We can put ourselves into the turtle willingly through swinging your legs in the direction away from the direction your opponent is leaning towards, then swing your legs the other way hard and push away. Then, keep swinging your legs side to side.

From here, you can push away and hopefully start [[Playing Open Guard]].

Other times, you will end up in a turtle position.

One way to escape the North South is by preventing the transition into it completely before it happens. Often times, you can see the North South transition coming from [[Side Control]] , or from [[Open Guard Passing]]. Once you see it, you can do your best to prevent it by posting on their shoulders with your hands, then curling up and pummeling your legs in to play [[Inverted Guard]].
