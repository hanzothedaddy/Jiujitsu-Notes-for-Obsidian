To pass a butterfly guard, you have to jam and kill the hooks. You can do that by weighing heavy on their feet and clamp down, sit on your butt.


# Bodylock Pass

One of the best ways to pass is through the Bodylock pass, which has an extensive and step-by-step method to do so.

The reason why bodylock passing is so effective is because you effectively jam and kill their butterfly hooks in the position.

You lock your hands behind their body with an S-grip or a Gable grip, then bring your hips down around their legs. In a bodylock pass, you want to pick a side to pass through, and lock your hands closer to that direction, freeing your opposite leg from the hook, getting a 2 on 1 hold to one of their butterfly hooks, then attempting to pass.
