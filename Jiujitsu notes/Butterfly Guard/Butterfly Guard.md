![[butterflyguard1.png]]This is probably one of my most important guards, and I don't understand it all too well yet.

However, I pulled a few fundamental videos and tips from butterfly guard players to see how to understand it.

# Starting Off

I watched this video from TeachMeGrappling that showed the basics and strengths of the butterfly guard. The butterfly guard is an offensive open guard that allows someone to control the inside space and attack. You can:

- Sweep people very easily
- Take [[Back Mount]] through [[Arm Drag]]
- Transition into other guards, such as [[Single Leg-X Guard]]
- Threaten submissions
- Take people off their base easier

I learned that this is a very **ACTIVE** guard, not a passive guard. Your butterfly hooks need to stay active at all times. A lot of hand fighting is involved, and you are at advantage to win the hand fights. You're the person who forces the reactions playing this guard.

# Submissions Available

[[Guillotine]]
[[Triangle]]
[[Armbar]]
[[Darce]], or Marce from an [[Arm Drag]]

# Attacking Angles

I think that butterfly guard can force a lot of reactions, and whichever direction they go in resist the movement, you can tip them in that way and get your attacks started. You can attack an opponent side to side, towards you, or away from you.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Fz-64lAs4&ab_channel=BernardoFariaBJJFanatics) from Jon Satava shows this principle.



To start off, the key for the butterfly hooks is to bring your opponents with you with your underhooks, take the ground off of them, then sweep them to the left or the right. The classic butterfly sweep. 

The key to the classic butterfly sweep is to load their hips onto yours by controlling the ground underneath them. The concept of becoming the ground and taking away the ground from the opponent is shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB9_9TgcH1o&ab_channel=KennyFlorian).


## Sweeps/Transitions

### Traditional Butterfly Guard Sweep

The traditional Butterfly Guard sweep is the classic sweep. You get an underhook or overhook on one side, then an overhook grip or a wrist grip on the other. Plant your foot on the side of the overhook, then turn and sweep him over into [[Mount]] or [[Side Control]].

Important to be postured up when you attempt the sweep, not on your back.

### Sumi Gaeshi Sweep

The Sumi Gaeshi sweep is a Gordon Ryan favorite. You get a gable grip around the opponent's arm, just around their shoulder area, then crunch tight. Sweep them over to the side of their trapped arm, since they cannot post with that arm, straight into [[Mount]].

You want to use your elbow to frame against their neck to give you a pushing force and you sweep them over.

### Double Underhook into X Guard Sweep

With double underhooks, it's easy to bring your opponent back towards you by rolling onto your back. They will most like post on both hands, which lets you transition into [[X Guard]]. From here, you can knock them over their own butt with a traditional X Guard sweep.

### Head and Arm Sweep

You grab onto their neck, and their wrist or overhook on the other side, then sweep them that way.

### 100% Sweep

This sweep is mostly done if they try to pass your butterfly guard. When they push into you and they leave space around their arm, try to wedge your hand in, wrap around their arm, gable grip, and crank them over the other way for the 100% sweep.

### Double Leg

If they posture up to avoid getting swept, you can stand up and shoot a [[Double Leg]].

### Arm Drag

[[Arm Drag]]s give you access to multiple avenues of attack. One, it exposes their back if they fall all the way into [[Turtle]], allowing you to take [[Back Mount]]. You can also attempt a [[Darce]] choke. If they resist and posture up, shoot a [[Double Leg]].

### Snapdown

You can hit a [[Snapdown]] and start attacking [[Front Headlock]] attacks.

# What do I do when they stand up to pass?

You have many options for when they stand up. You can wrestle up and transition into a [[Single Leg]] takedown, and you can even transition into other guards, such as:

- [[Single Leg-X Guard]]
- [[X Guard]]
- [[De La Riva Guard]] and [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]]
- [[Shin to Shin Guard]]
