The Single Leg-X guard, also known as **Ashi Garami**, is a position where you are between your opponent's legs, and one leg is outside their legs, and the other is on the thigh of that same opponent leg. Your wrap your legs around their leg, forming an "X" position. Your close arm is most likely wrapping around their ankle.

# Guard Control

It's important to keep your **hips up off the floor** in SLX. They should be so high up that your heel of the outside foot touches your inside foot.

From here, the outside leg should be wrapped all the way around and placed on their hip for more control, and to prevent them from passing you. From here, pinch your knees in, and control the close ankle with your arm wrapped around.

If you feel like they are trying to de-tangle your legs, you can even grab your own ankle with your freehand to prevent them from untangling your legs from SLX.

## Single Leg-X Sweep

The SLX Sweep can be done by establishing a grip with your freehand around the other leg's ankle, calves, whatever you can get a grip on first. Then, you hip up, use the heel on his hip and push him away. You can even turn the opponent's knee out as you sweep to make it better.

It is important that both your knees face the same direction in this sweep! This is to prevent the opponent from posturing back up.

From this position, wrap your arm around their other ankle, and you can stand up to get the top position.

### What if they step back so you can't grab their far leg?

This is even better for you, as the wider they base out (the more they do the splits) the more unstable their base is. So you can actually force them into a bad situation by reaching for their far leg, and as  they base far out, you can easily sweep them without the leg grip.

# Submissions

Single Leg-X lets you do leg lock attacks from the Single Leg-X Sweep, which include:

## Straight Ankle Lock

To do the [[Straight Ankle Lock]] from SLX sweep, you can take the ankle grip on their bottom foot an keep it, then form a guillotine grip on the ankle. The most important part is to tuck the elbow in, then you fall towards their ankle, and arch your back for the tap.

The opponent will turn towards the ankle lock side to roll out or relieve pressure, so as they start to turn, you go belly down and you push your hips up and down to the floor to get a **belly down Straight Ankle Lock**.

## Heel Hook

To do the [[Heel Hook]] from SLX sweep, put pressure on the bottom foot by going belly down. You can use your top hand to help you push their leg back towards them to create leverage.

With the arm that's on the bottom, you want to reach back and expose their heel, as your belly down, and get a gable grip. This heel hook requires you to hip in towards their knee, and pulling with the gable grip to the middle of the chest to get the tap.

# Entries into Single Leg-X

There are a lot of entries into SLX, which include:

- [[Shin to Shin Guard]]
- [[Butterfly Guard]]
- [[Half Butterfly Guard]]
- [[Half Guard Bottom]]


From Single Leg-X, I know that you can expose their heel for a [[Heel Hook]]. We also have access to the single leg x sweep, 

# Transitions

You can transition straight into [[X Guard]] by weaving the outside leg in to the opponent's far thigh.

# Passing SLX

To pass SLX, posture and a strong base is very important. You want a staggered stance with the far leg away from the opponent, so that they cannot grab your leg to sweep you.

From here, some ideas for passing SLX involve pummeling the top leg with your hands and untangling the legs. You want to push to top leg away and towards them, and as long as you can get the leg free, you are in a position to pass their SLX Guard.

After you untangle the leg, exert forward pressure and base your hands beneath their armpits. From here, it's essentially a [[Floating Pass]] over their leg that's under, and
