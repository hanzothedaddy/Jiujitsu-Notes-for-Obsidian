The kneecut pass is one of the most common and standard open guard passes. This can be used to pass many open guards, and it's a key concept in a lot of BJJ, not just to pass open guard.

A very important part of this pass is the underhook on the side that you are passing, and your head on the other side of their head. This is because you are driving with your head to flatten them out to their backs.

Along with this, if you get an overhook with your outside hand over their arm and pull their arm, it solidifies the pass into side control.



The buzzsaw cut pass is a pass that has been popularized by Andrew Wiltse, where it is a kneecut over their belly.
