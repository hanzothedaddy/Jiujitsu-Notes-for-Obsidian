The X pass is called an X pass because of the formation your arms get into when you are trying to pass.

The X Pass is a form of a [[Loose Guard Pass]]. It is normally used to pass when you are standing, and your opponent tries to get the inside position with butterfly hooks to get into other guards, such as [[De La Riva Guard]] or [[Butterfly Guard]]. Pummel your legs and get one of your feet in between.

Then, control their leg that's in between yours, and the other hand on their torso.

Post your outside leg far, then DONKEY KICK your leg that's in between backwards, and shove their knees away from you.

At this position, your hands should be in an "X" formation.

Go into [[Knee On Belly]].
