Open Guard passing is one of the hardest things in BJJ to do. Your goal is to clear their leg and pass their hip line somehow, then achieve a position like halfguard, side control or straight to mount. 

Open guard passing generally is dependent on how the opponent's leg configuration is. This is the reason why you should study a lot of different open guard passes and understand what position gives you access to certain guard passes.

Some key things to remember is that open guard is a very general term for a variety of guards that the opponent can play, such as as Seated Guard, Butterfly Guard, etc.

You can always force someone on their back if you push them back, or pull their legs up, or both.

## Standard Open Guard Passing

If your opponent is playing a very standard open guard, with their knees not too high, or not too low, you can use:

- [[Kneecut Pass]]
- [[Side Smash Pass]] and [[Floating Pass]]
- Combine Kneecuts and Side Smash with [[A-B Pass]]

These guard passes are great to try for passing these open guards, and it's my go-to. I normally try to get one of my legs in between their legs to achieve a good headquarters position.

You can also pass the guard with some [[Loose Guard Pass]]es, which include:

- [[Toreando Pass]]
- [[Leg Drag Pass]]
- [[X Pass]]

Where you get more mobility as you pass, and it is less of a pressure pass compared to the the kneecuts and side smash options.

## Flexible/High Open Guard Passing

Sometimes, your opponent will be flexible, or their leg will be higher up to prevent you from controlling their knees, or giving you the opportunity to go into headquarters. In instances like this, their biggest weakness is going backwards, so some passes we can try on these would be:

- [[Stack Pass]]

## Wide Legs/On their Side Open Guard Passing

A lot of times, your opponent will be on their side, or have their legs wide when you try to pass. This is dangerous at times because they invite you into their inside space, as they look to close up their guard if you mess up the pass. The biggest weakness we can exploit in these instance is to pin one of their legs to the floor to pass.

- [[Half Stack Pass]]
- [[Longstep Pass]]

These passes both involve pinning one of their legs to the floor, and carefully passing through their inside space.

## General Ideas

Some general ideas for open guard passing to keep in mind is:

- Always keep some sort of control on their legs, whether it's on their ankles, or their knees
- To pass a guard, you do have to stay close to them, and a mistake that a lot of beginners make is to stay too far away
