For De La Riva, your legs are between one of the opponent's legs, and the outside leg hooks behind the knee. The other foot should be posted on their hip. Usually, your hands would be cupped outside the opponent's ankle for that leg control.

# Difference between Reverse DLR

Regular DLR, the OUTSIDE foot hooks behind the opponent's legs, and in the reverse DLR, the INSIDE foot hooks in.

# Attacking ideas

You can wrestle up from DLR by ==[[De La Riva Guard#^o0aixb|knocking the opponents forward by offbalancing them that way with you feet.]]== From here, you can ==[[De La Riva Guard#^96aztp|remove the hip post leg]]==, then start to wrestle up into a [[Single Leg]]. Or, if you can reach the other ankle with your other hand, you can wrestle up into a [[Double Leg]].
