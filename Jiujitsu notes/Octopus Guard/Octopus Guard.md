The octopus guard is mainly played from [[Half Guard Bottom]], when you swing past the right (far) hand and reach around their hips. From here, you have to act quickly, and kill their leg posts to sweep them. [Craig Jone's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwzqqnWESxw&t=23s&ab_channel=B-TeamJiuJitsu)

Can also play from [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]] as well if you swing past one of their arms.

This sweep's ideas are very similar to the Kimura Sweep. Instead of covering their arm as it happens in the kimura sweep, you cover their leg, very similar idea.

You can also go into the [[Front Headlock]] position from octopus guard by backing up.

Another Idea is to transition into [[Back Mount]], by replacing your left hand with your right hand, post with your left, the swim up to the back. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GiqoAZmI18&ab_channel=BrandonQuick)



Key idea I learned from a friend is to cup your free hand on their knee. This is because the opponent will try to get a crossface back on you to sweep you back on the other side. If they pressure in, you can get the hipbump sweep much easier.

### Key Ideas
- The opponent will automatically push against you to kill your octopus guard. You have to secure their ANKLE to prevent their post before they do.
- Once the sweep happens, the octopus guard sweep allows the opponent to counter octopus sweep. As soon as the sweep happens, you have to swing your leg around and grab both legs. This allows us to [[Back Mount]] take by sitting out if they push up against us.
