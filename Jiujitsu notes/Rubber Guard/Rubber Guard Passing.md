Marcelo Garcia has an [excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANxiPpAzACU&ab_channel=InAction) on some rubber guard escapes and techniques.

There's two ways out of the rubber guard - by pulling outwards, or by driving forward into [[Half Guard Top]].

One of the most important frames for escaping the rubber guard is your elbow on their bottom leg to prevent them from closing that in. Blocking the bottom leg gives you space to work. This will be pretty imporant for both escapes.

## Pull Out Escape

The pull out escape is done by turning your arm stuck in the rubber guard thumb down, then pushing off the elbow frame on their bottom leg, then you glue your chin to your chest, and pull your head out, almost like escaping the triangle choke.

## Drive Forward Escape

First, secure the elbow post on the bottom leg, then stick your face into their chest first to prevent any threat of submission. The elbow post should give you space to push your knee through like a [[Kneecut Pass]], then you can stick your other knee in. This will allow you to drive through and effectively break their hold on their rubber guard.
