The Rubber Guard is a 10th Planet trademark guard that involves controlling the opponent from the bottom by holding onto your own leg above the opponent's head and arm. It is sort of unorthodox, but it is a very powerful position that can lead to strong attacks if used correctly.

# Playing Rubber Guard

I'm not gonna pretend like I know much about Rubber Guard, because I really don't. I would definitely need someone to expand on this section.

10th Planet has a lot of interesting names to define positions and transitions in between, and I don't have a good enough understanding of all the positions to be able to explain it. Somebody please help lol
