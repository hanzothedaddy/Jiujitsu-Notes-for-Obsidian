If you can tip them, you can sweep them.

If they post, that means their weight is briefly on the post. Use it and find the time to re-position.

T-rex arms can save you from a lot of submissions.

You prevent a lot of passes by connecting your elbows to your knees to close that space.

Always push one way before pushing to the other (action reaction)

The more points of contact you have with opponent, the better your control
Isolating a limb can help the fights (4 vs 3)

Wherever the head goes, the opponent goes. Don't ever let opponent control head

To control and manipulate someone's head, grab the crown of their head, not their neck

Often times, if you clear the opponent's arms, that's the main thing that would be keeping you from taking their back from any position. Clear the arm, then you'll start to see opportunities to take the back.
