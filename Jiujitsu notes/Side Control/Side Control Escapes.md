## Standard Escape

- Frame your hand on their neck and one on the hip. Push and bridge, and make space for your legs to come in and retain guard

## Ghost Escape

- The idea is to take your right hand and wedge it under their belly. Then, we swing our hips towards their legs, and propel the other way and swing under
- Hold onto their head to go into a [[Darce]] choke
