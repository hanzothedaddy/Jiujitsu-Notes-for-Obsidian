Side control is my favorite control to establish before going into things like mount. Lots of submissions also available from here.

## How Can I Apply Pressure?

The goal of side control is to not let the opponent turn towards you. If they can, they can retain their guard or sweep you.

To prevent them from turning towards you, you need to apply pressure. You can do so by not letting your knees touch the mat barely, and driving with your feet. If you are on your knees, your weight is on your knees. [Lachlan Giles video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTi6bCBsEbM&ab_channel=AbsoluteMMAStKilda-Melbourne).

You can crush their face with your cross face to apply pressure as well. This prevents the opponent from turning in to face you.

And of course, you can apply pressure by [[Knee On Belly]].

## Key Ideas
- Crush their face with your crossface
- In gi, grab their gi collar from under their neck with your left hand
- If their back is flat on the mat, they can't face you, so they will not be able to bridge
- You can grab their pant legs to bunker them down
- Hips heavy to mat, and right hand for balance
- Can also gable grip
