Fantastic control position, normally done from securing [[Side Control]]. From Knee on Belly, you can force the opponent to react to your pressure on their belly. This gives you a strong striking position, while being able to transition into [[North South]] or slide the knee over into [[Mount]].

It's important that you post the leg that is not on their belly far outwards to apply the most pressure.

There is a "nice" way to secure the knee on belly, which is to place your knee and shinbone on their hips.

However, if you want to apply pressure, you dig your knee straight into their solar plexus, and that will definitely provide some reaction from them.

The most amount of pressure you can generate is by decreasing the area that you are applying the force through, and increasing the force applied downwards. In other words, try to dig your knee into their solar plexus and post for maximum pressure.
