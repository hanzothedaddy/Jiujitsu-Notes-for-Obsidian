As the top player in Closed Guard, we look to pass the guard and find a more advantageous position.

### Key Notes

- Let's try not to keep one arm in and one arm out, get triangle'd
- Keep posture upright
- Stay on your toes
- control their inner legs and push down, and try going one direction rather than straight ahead
- If you stay heavy on your butt, they will not be able to sweep you easily

# Troubleshooting

### Bottom Player Puts you in a Body Triangle?

You can [[Calf Slicer]] them with their own foot by hopping over their lock foot, trapping it between your legs and chest, and pressing down.

### Additional Notes

As of making this note, I've had struggle passing people's closed guard because its so tight. I think I have to remember to push into one direction, rather than straight on. I've had more success with the stand up burst passes and the head and arm pass.
