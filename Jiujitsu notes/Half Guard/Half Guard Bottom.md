Playing Half guard is sometimes known as a "last layer" of defense to some, but if played correctly, it can become a powerful attacking position with lots of sweeps [[Wrestling]] up opportunities. It is a guard where it is two of your legs versus one of their legs, so there definitely is some sort of advantage.

# Fundamentals

A crucial key to fighting in Half guard is playing on your side, not on your back. Your opponent will want to crossface you with their opposite arm and flatten you on your back to pass your Half guard, so playing on your side and constantly handfighting to block their crossface arm is very important.

Notice that Lachlan Giles monitors and blocks the crossface arm at all times.

## Grips

The grips that we use on bottom of half guard depend on how strong your lower body control is. The halfguard player can attack an overhook or even a [[Collar Tie]], but because the opponent is looking for an underhook, if your lower body control is not secure enough, once they pass your legs, they will go straight into an underhook position. Therefore, once you have a strong lower body control, you can start to implement "riskier" hand positions. There is a fantastic [analysis of this from Less Impressed More Involved BJJ on this](https://youtu.be/u2MdN95-wOQ?si=yNY2Rj-wPTthmcA_).
## Kneeshield Mechanics




# Angles of Attacks

## Closeside Underhook

You can grab a leftside underhook and this would be one of the main ways to attack. You can always clear space under their armpit by holding a higher kneeshield, and slipping your arms past under your kneeshield leg.

When you grab it, it's important to first, keep your head glued close to their chest. This way, it prevents guillotine attempts. Then, grab a coyote hook on their close leg with your left leg, then sit up onto your knees.  This is [[Dogfight]] position.

More on this in the [[Dogfight]] position section.

From this position, the opponent could try to grab a whizzer on the underhooked arm.

The attacker can take [[Back Mount]], but it might not happen.

From this position, you can take away their hand as a post, then push through to grab a [[Half Guard Top]]. 

The opponent could also start to push into you, in which case you can lay back down, load their hips, grab their leg and sweep them in the direction they are pushing.

During this transition, you can grab a [[Triangle]] falling back down, or even a [[Guillotine]].

## Closeside Overhook

Grabbing a leftside overhook allows us to enter a strong [[Williams Guard]]. Or, if you can, enter straight into a [[Triangle]], Lachlan Giles style (enter video)

The overhook can be used to attack from the bottom in a Ruotolo brother style, where you hanker down on the arm heavy with a whizzer, and start to look away as you build your base up.

## Swinging Under their Crossface Arm

You can shoot under the right arm to enter [[Octopus Guard]].

## Attack the Crossface Arm

You can attack the right arm with both hands for a [[Kimura]]. From here, you can attack a [[Kimura]] trap, which is a very strong dilemma you put your opponent into.

The [[Kimura]] trap from bottom half is a powerful position that gives you strong advantages if your opponent tries to defend your attack.

If your opponent tries to defend your attack by hiding that arm, it gives you leverage to push them up and over their head as a Kimura sweep that puts you in a top position that allows you to finish the Kimura from the top.

If they hide the hand and base far back so you can't sweep them, you can unlock your legs and swing all the way around to take [[Back Mount]].




You can also grab a strong Z-Guard and do a choi bar style [[Armbar]] on the arm as well.
