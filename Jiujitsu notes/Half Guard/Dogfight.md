Also known as the Coyote Guard. This is a fantastic position when you get an underhook from a bottom position to a top position, wrestle, or even take the back.

# Entries

The most common entry I know to the Dogfight position is through [[Half Guard Bottom]]. You can shoot an underhook from your kneeshield side arm and hook their close leg with your kneeshield leg.

Other entries I know include:

- Quarter-Guard
- Counter knee slide passes
- From bottom of Side Control as a [[Side Control Escapes]]

All the entries are from getting an underhook on the opponent.

# Dogfight Fundamentals



# Underhook Player


# Whizzer Player

The most common defense, or response to the dogfight position is by inserting a heavy [[Whizzer]] on the opponent's underhook. By inserting a whizzer, you prevent the opponent from freely taking your back, as well as giving the ability to pressure their shoulder downwards.

Defending against the Dogfight, you are in a good position to attempt a Whizzer [[Uchimata]]. You can take the close leg
