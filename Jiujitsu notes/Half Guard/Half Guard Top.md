## Passing Sequences

### Tripod Pass

Tripod pass requires a double underhook on the opponent to flatten them out, learned in class. Then, you plant your head on the side of the guard, and you can kneeslice or shake the leg slowly out. Then, slide out into side control.

### Backstep Pass

There was a certain [[Kneebar]] entry that can happen from this backstep pass we learned in class.
