The gift wrap is an extremely strong holding position done by wrapping the opponent's arm around their neck/face, and grabbing their wrist from the other side, effectively straightjacketing their arm to their face.

The gift wrap is a strong tool that you can implement in positions like [[Mount]] and [[Side Control]] that leads you to an avenue to take [[Back Mount]], or submit them with [[Armbar]]s or a sneaky gift wrap [[Ezekiel]] done by sneaking your other hand in through the gap of their gift wrap, and squeezing up towards their neck.

# Escaping the Gift Wrap

An attempt that you can try to escape the gift wrap is to pummel your other arm in through the bottomside of the arm that is gift wrapped, then grabbing your own face with that hand. This will allow you to peel your own hand up, then quickly turn into your opponent.
