Power Pins is changing the way that I'm viewing control in Jiujitsu, and it's a big concept to consider drilling. If you'd like to learn more about power pins, buy Craig Jones' instructional DVD and learn from it.

Power pins are not a way to abandon the traditional ways of control through Jiujitsu, but should be supplementary to controlling and tiring out the opponent.
# Main idea

The main idea of a power pin involves beginning control of an opponent's legs. This is because in any situation, if you are trying to control your opponent, **all of their escapes begin with putting their feet on the floor to generate power off the mat to begin driving their hips.** So, if we kill the opponent's ability to effectively put their feet on the floor, you kill a majority of your opponent's escaping maneuvers.

Traditional controls, such as [[Side Control]] and [[Mount]], and even [[Back Mount]] are all good positions as you are on top, but they all fail to have effective control of the legs. Power pins re-shapes the idea of control and challenges modern Jiujitsu by providing more control, but less "traditional points" that go by the points system in Jiujitsu. However, with properly using pins, we get equal amounts of submission openings.

Pinning the opponent's legs to the floors kills an opponent's:

- Underhook escapes
- Bridge and shrimp escapes
- Effective stamina

The ideas and principles are as follows:

1. Control their lower body
2. Pin the legs
3. Split the legs
4. Control their upper body

If we follow these properly, it will cause a great amount of exhaustion and discomfort in the opponents that naturally will put the opponents into disadvantageous positions by trying to relieve the discomfort, and it will ultimately lead to submissions and higher levels of control throughout.

# Rear Mount

The rear mount is different than a [[Back Mount]] in the sense that the rear mount looks like a traditional [[Mount]], but with the opponent face down. Craig Jones argues that the rear mount is the strongest position in all of Jiujitsu.

# Entries

## Side Control Entries

You can enter into this riding style from [[Side Control]] by taking advantage of the opponent's escape routes. 

The opponent would normally be looking to escape Side Control by pushing them away and inserting their legs underneath the hips and 

## Mount Entries

## Back Control Entries

## Entries from Leg Drag

We can enter into these power pins through the [[Leg Drag Pass]] position.

Instead of the standard leg drag pass into side control, the power pin has a different approach. 

From the leg drag, Craig Jones emphasizes to stack into their leg and to pin their leg with your other leg and split their legs further. Then, it gives you room with the other leg to pin the top leg down as well, which gives you extremely great control over the opponent.

## Entries from Smash Pass

We can enter into power pins through the [[Side Smash Pass]] position. 

## Entries from Dope Mount Pass

We can enter into power pins through a modified [[Dope Mount Pass]] position.

# Submissions Available

## Arm Triangle

The [[Arm Triangle]] is a steadily available submission when going for power pins, especially because of the use of the claw grip.

## RNC

The [[Rear Naked Choke]] shows itself as one of the easiest chokes from the Rear Mount position, which tends to be the "ultimate" end position of power pinning an opponent.
