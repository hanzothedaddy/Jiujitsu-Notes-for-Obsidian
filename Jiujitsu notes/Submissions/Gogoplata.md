The Gogoplata is a choke using the top of the foot directly on the opponent's throat, and it's a pretty nasty choke.

# Entries

For the most part, I've seen Gogoplatas being done from:

- [[Rubber Guard]]
- [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]]
- [[Williams Guard]]
- [[Omoplata]] attempts

The most common finish I've seen is to stick the foot under their neck, and grabbing your own foot from the other side.

## Gogo Clinch

The [Gogo clinch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adm-FC1iyHo&ab_channel=BJJFanatics) is also a common variation of the Gogoplata I like from the [[Rubber Guard]].
