Von Flue Chokes are mainly done as a counter to [[Guillotine]] chokes. Sometimes, your opponent will grab onto your chin for a little too long when they don't have it secured at all, and you can punish them for holding on.

The classic position to do this from when someone latches on a Guillotine on you, so you pass their guard into [[Side Control]], and the opponent is still gripping onto your neck. First of all, there is no threat of a choke at the moment, because your choke is on the back of your neck. So, begin by trapping their hand with your arms.

You can do this by gable gripping your hand around their choking arm and their opposing side shoulder.

From here, you can drive your shoulder into their neck and squeeze the gable for the choke.
