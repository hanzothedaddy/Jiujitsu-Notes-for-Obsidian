The anaconda choke is part of the [[Front Headlock]] attack series, and a very cool one at that too.

# Anaconda or Darce?

The Anaconda and Darce chokes are very similar chokes, as it involves both your head and arms in the choke. The main difference is that the arm for the anaconda enters from their neckside, while the Darce enters from under their arm side.

Due to this, the Anaconda, [[Darce]],  [[Japanese Necktie]], and [[Peruvian Necktie]] are all very easily transitionable if you recognize when to transition the chokes. You can punch your hands all the way through to the other side to get a Darce, and vice versa.

# Choke Details

A big part of the anaconda choke involves the compression of their neck over your choking arm. This is done by compressing their neck into the strangle arm by driving your chest into the back of their neck as you start to lock in and walk towards their leg. 

If done correctly, the anaconda choke doesn't require much of a heavy squeeze with the arms, as its your chest that does most of the compression.

Once you walk over, you will be racing against the opponent to lock the choke in by latching your legs to their legs, or even latching onto their arm if possible.

## Troubleshooting the Choke

If the opponent starts basing up from the choke, you can recognize it as soon as you can, and transition into the [[Darce]] series of attacks.

# Common Choke Positions

- [[Front Headlock]]: the most common position to attack the anaconda from is from Front Headlock. As you get a gable grip around their head and arm, you can peel their arm in with the gable grip, effectively removing their base. Then, you gator roll underneath them and roll them completely over. When you gator roll, stick your head close to the opponent's lats where you removed their base to prevent rolling over yourself.

  From here, you can slide the gable hand over and start locking up the anaconda.

  Some important tips is to not lock it up too early for this setup! You want a gable grip to peel off their base with your elbows tightly.

- Standing [[Front Headlock]]: if you get a solid lock on their head and arm from a standing snapdown, you can block their feet with yours, then fall back into your butt as you bring them with you. This should allow you to go straight into the choke.

# Defenses

One idea for defending against the anaconda choke is to take your hands and post against their hip to prevent them from walking in towards you. Since the compression of the choke is their rotation towards you, you can prevent it by stopping their hips from coming in.

One late defense idea is to run away from their walk towards your legs and arms. While they most likely will catch up to you, it will buy you some time to think of preventions and escapes.
