![[armtriangle1.jpg]]There's a ton of ways to get to the arm triangle and finish mechanics. Due to this, I tried to break down the choke into it's details to help understand the mechanics of the choke.

# Common Choke Positions

Arm Triangle is normally done from:

- [[Mount]]
- [[Half Guard Top]]
- [[Side Control]]

And achievable sometimes from:

- [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]]
- [[Half Guard Bottom]]

# Choke Mechanics

The principles of the Arm Triangle choke is similar to a real Triangle choke. 

Just like the Triangle choke, the choke begins with a **strong bite.** This means that the crossface arm has to be very deep around their neck to apply the most effective choke.

The other part of this choke being effective is the opponent's shoulder on the other side of the choke applying pressure. Due to this, we need something to drive their shoulder to their neck after we get a good bite on the choke.

To try to get a good understanding of how exactly we are going to finish the choke, you can actually finish this choke with one hand.

You can test this yourself: from Mount, get a deep bite around the opponents neck, and drive your chest into their shoulder to get the tap.

As long as you get the core principles of the choke, the finishes should become more and more intuitive.

# Setup

The classic setup involves crawling the arm up from a top position. First, start with securing a deep crossface bite on their neck.

If you can, it's important to lean off to the side of the crawling arm to prevent being swept.

You can slowly crawl up right underneath their elbow. Think of getting the maximum amount of torque on their arm by being at the end of the lever.

Once you crawl the arm slowly all the way up, you can sink your head on the opposite side of their arm, right next to their shoulder, holding tightly with your crossface arm and face.

# Finish Details

## Dismount

The classic way to finish this choke is to dismount from [[mount]] to the side after securing an S-grip behind their neck. Make sure that the crossface arm palm is facing downwards here.

When dismounting, make sure to windshield wiper your legs across their body to prevent your legs getting caught.

After dismounting, you can sprawl and clamp down, then begin driving your head or chest towards their shoulder. Start to rotate perpendicular with their body to tighten the choke.

## Mounted Finish

Craig Jones has a strong mounted finish that I actually prefer over the standard dismounting finish.



Sometimes, you catch them in an Arm Triangle from [[Half Guard Top]], which prevents you from dismounting. Some people prefer the mounted finish as it secures their position still, so it's good to know the details of this.

To do a mounted finish, the gable grip is preferred. You want to get your face or chest close to their shoulder. From here, you puff your chest out, driving hard into their shoulder, while squeezing the bite arm to get the tap.

## Answer the Phone Finish

I've seen someone finish the arm triangle by answering the phone to tighten the choke from [[Half Guard Bottom]] and [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]]. 

After getting a bite, stick your head as close to their shoulder as possible, then grab your own bicep. With the other arm, drive it up to the back of your neck to tighten the choke, and squeeze.

# Transitions

Sometimes, the opponent will drive hard to the opposite side to escape the choke. However, you can set up a rear [[Ezekiel]] choke by following them to the [[Back Mount]] and finishing with a rear naked style grip.

# Defenses

## Early prevention
- If their setup for crawling the arm up is not optimal, be prepared to limp arm and drop it to escape it early.
- A very common early escape is answering the phone. If you grab your own head with the arm trapped in the choke, you make your shoulders and neck wider, making it harder to finish the choke for the opponent.
- A method of avoiding the arm triangle early on is to offbalance them as they're setting it up. When they start to crawl up the hand, you can take the hand that is getting taken and aggressively crossface them and hipturn in that direction. That should offbalance them enough to push them that way so you can behind your escapes.

## Late Escapes
- A late escape for the Arm Triangle involves hipping and completely turning away from the choke. While this relieves from the submission, it does give the opponent the back take. At least you're not getting choked out lol.
