buggy choke can be done from bottom of [[Side Control]] as a [[Side Control Escapes]] tactic, or to win from bottom of side control. 

This choke can be done at any time that you have your opponent's head and arms on your side, so do with that information as you will.

This does require you to have decently lanky and long limbs. 

I'm not too familiar on the buggy choke, so here is a [video by the Ruotolo brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_3YYrWEGoU&ab_channel=BJJFanatics)
