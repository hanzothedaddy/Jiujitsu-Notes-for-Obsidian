Guillotines are nice and efficient, and there are a variety of finishes for the guillotine, as well as grips.

Guillotines are available from many positions, such as:

- [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]]
- [[Half Guard Top]]
- [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Dogfight]]
- [[Butterfly Guard]]
- [[Turtle]]
- [[Front Headlock]]
- [[Octopus Guard]]
- Defending against [[Single Leg]] and [[double leg]]
- [[Mount]]


You get the idea.

# Head-in Guillotine

The head-in guillotine is the most common grip to a guillotine, I'd say. There's many variations to finish these.

A pro to this grip is that it's super easy to snatch up, and it's very efficient when finished correctly. It's one of the most common responses to say a [[Single Leg]] or [[double leg]] takedown, and many other uses as well.

### Standard Finish

The most common way to finish a guillotine is to get a wristwatch grip on your wrist and bring your arms high up your chest. The focus is to make the gap in your arm as tiny as possible, cutting the arteries using your choking arms forearm and bicep.

### Cody McKenzieTine

It's also possible to finish these by pummeling your arm all the way through, and pulling your own arm up and pushing it in. You can do this by gripping your own wrist and pushing it sideways into their neck, or as Cody McKenzie did it, make a prayer palm motion and push in with the praying hand.

### Marcelotine

The Marcelotine finish is sometimes referred to as the high elbow finish. It involves flexing the gripping hand's forearm forward, and resting it on the opponent's shoulder. The benefits of this grip is to prevent the opponent from driving forward to stop the guillotine, as the gripping hand's forearm acts as a frame to stop them from going forward.

### OK Grip (Hook Grip)

The OK grip is a bit weird to explain. Sometimes, the Marcelotine finish is a little jarring on your wrists and flexibility. To make this frame easier, you can turn the gripping hand palm inwards, bend the wrist, and place the forearm on their shoulder this way.

To hold this grip, you can make an OK sign with your choking hand. This creates a hook for you to insert your pinky and ring finger both into that hook, and you can pull that to finish this guillotine.

### Front Naked Grip

The front naked grip finish is basically like finishing a rear naked choke, but from the front. With the chip strap, grab your own bicep, and drive the forearm of the other hand down their neck, while squeezing.

# Arm-in Guillotine

The arm-in guillotine is considered harder to finish. However, understanding the choke is critical to finishing these.

A pro to this grip is that it feels like it has the most control out of all the variations. Since you have one of their arm, and you crunch over their other arm when trying to finish this choke, it eliminates both those arms so they have a smaller chance of fighting back.

To finish the arm-in guillotine, Garry Tonon emphasizes how critical it is to bring your hands to your chest, and to also apply compression force by "rocking" in towards the choke, not away. The reason why we crunch in instead of out is to compress their neck in over the choking arm towards their chest, and that's the key detail in the finish.

A common mistake that happens is that we tend to watch to extend outwards by arching away from the choke, but the correct response is to crunch and "rock the baby" towards their side.

Chewjitsu recommends trying a pretzel grip (reverse gable) to finish this choke.

Because of these finish details, it's also very important to cut the angle towards the choke, instead of laying flat on the back.

A very easy way to address this is to set it up correctly from the beginning with intent. When you grab the guillotine, start to shift your head and shoulder over the opponent's head when you start to fall into the guillotine.

# Head and Arm-in Guillotine

The head and arm-in guillotine is more like an Arm Triangle type of finish, where both their head and arm is inside the guillotine. The arm-in guillotine, as a comparison, has the hand stuck on the opposite side of the choke.

A very common finish and leg configuration for this is the modified [[Butterfly Guard]], where the choke-side leg is placed under their hip, while the other leg is wrapped on the top side on their back.

# Defenses 

See the general defense for [[Front Headlock Defenses]] for a good general defense against guillotines.

You can either drive hard forward to loosen their grip, or attempt to pop your head out by creating space and pushing against their arm to free your neck.

When you drive forward, you can plant your head on the mat use it as a base to weaken their choke. Then, throw your opposite side arm up their shoulder, so you can use it as leverage to keep driving.

If you pass their guard and they hold onto your head, first, focus on being perpendicular to them. This places your corrodid arteries safe from the choke. Then, you can [[Von Flue Choke]] them to punish it.

The longer the opponent forces a guillotine and fails, the more it tires their arm, which means that once you're free, they will be very tired to defend against your attacks.

# Key Details

- It's important that we stay postured upright when applying the guillotine, not on your back! That's because you can adjust much better, and you have all the space from being upright and laying back to finish it. So yes, sit up, but you also can start laying to finish.
- Don't hold onto the choke for too long once they pass your guard already, since you can get [[Von Flue Choke]]d if you're not careful.
