As the name implies, this choke is done from the [[North South]] position.

# Choke Details

To finish a good North South choke, you need to pressure with your chest and keep sprawling from [[North South]] position. This choke is notoriously difficult to finish as a clean choke, and often ends up being a jaw or neck crank.

This choke involves us driving our shoulder and squeezing our arms around their neck to get the finish. In order to get the most effective choke, we need as much of our weight transferred into their neck as possible.

Marcelo Garcia suggests to [keep sprawling further back, and driving your shoulder into the neck](https://youtu.be/VkI7wuhN2Ps).

Chewy from ChewJitsu suggests to drive your shoulder into their neck by [sprawling up onto your toes and driving with your feet into their neck](https://youtu.be/fyqluZ0CAXI). To me, these both make sense to hanker down onto their neck. 



# Troubleshooting the Choke

## Common Mistakes

### Being to High Up on their Body

Being too high up on their body is a common mistake in finishing this choke. Your head wants to be as low as possible when finishing it.

### Not locking up being their neck

If you don't lock up the S-grip or Gable grip behind their neck, they have much more freedom to move around. You want to lock their neck in place before you start sprawling out.

## Transitions out

If the North South choke doesn't work, prepare your non-choking hand in a chopping motion at their belly. Kneel up, and pop their head up into your other hand to catch them in a [[Rear Naked Choke]]. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzr-8UA6oxY&ab_channel=ZombieProofBJJ)
