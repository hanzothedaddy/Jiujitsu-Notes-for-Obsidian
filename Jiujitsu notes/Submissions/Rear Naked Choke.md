# Choke Mechanics

You can finish a good rear naked choke with one hand, and that should give you a better sense of the choking details. You can get one hand around their neck, and what you do is you squeeze and do a ==[[Rear Naked Choke#^y29617|pulling back motion with the arm]]==.

A good rear naked choke doesn't require a lot of squeezing if set up correctly. With the hand around their neck, slide your hand like a spear behind their head. You want to sneak the hand behind their neck, otherwise they can grab your hand.

With the choke locked up, you want your head right besides theirs, then you squeeze and push down with your head to get the tap.

Technically, you can also get a choke/compression tap if the opponent has their chin underneath, you can just squeeze and it should still be a tap.

# Handfighting

Handfighting is one of the most important aspects to get your choke straight. 

One important tip for handfighting is that you have a lot of leverage over them if you grab them at their palm, around their pinky.

Our goal with handfighting is to systematically break down their defenses and get a choke.

### Modified Rear Naked Choke

There is this version of the rear naked where you first have their head and arm with a gable grip from the rear. Then, you sprawl out and crank their neck over your arms. It looks like a reverse arm-in guillotine. I've also heard this referred to as a type of "bulldog choke".
