If you like [[Darce]] chokes but you got short arms, the Japanese Necktie is for you.

# Choke Details

Often times, people get confused as to if the Japanese Necktie is a neck crank, or a choke. The Japanese Necktie is a combination of both.

After we get our chest behind their head with a vice grip around their neck and arms, you start to compress their neck towards their chest and up towards the ceiling at the same time. Effectively, you are trying to twist their neck off and choke them, as Brandon Mccaghren puts it.

It is crucial that you hook one of their legs with yours to pull them into the choke, so it is often best to start to set it up with one of their legs hooked already. 

More of these details can be seen and covered in [Brandon Mccaghren's Japanese Necktie video](https://youtu.be/9ayYUGACAQs).
# Common Choke Positions

The Japanese Necktie is normally available from:

- [[Half Guard Top]]
- [[Turtle]]
- [[Front Headlock]]
- Transition from [[Anaconda]]

These setups are well explained in this [video with Boogeyman Martinez](https://youtu.be/cQm0ODX7fbc).

A setup that I see Lachlan Giles go for a lot for Japanese Neckties and Darces is from [[Half Guard Top]] getting an underhook on the side arm, but to connect with your own head. Then, the other head gets a headlock, and Lacklan scoops that underhook grip into an overhead grip, now connecting his arms.

If the Japanese Necktie fails, [[Peruvian Necktie]] is a fall back choke to go to. Since the grip is already there, you just need to sit up and throw the legs on top to finish it.
