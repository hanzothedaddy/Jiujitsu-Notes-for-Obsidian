The Darce is a great and powerful submission.

# Common Positions

The Darce is normally available from:

- [[Front Headlock]]
- [[Butterfly Guard]]
- Attacking [[Turtle]]
- [[Half Guard Top]]
- [[Knee On Belly]]
- [[Side Control]]



## Shallow Darce

## Marce

Aka the sliding Darce. 

## Knee on Belly Darce

The [Gracies do a fantastic 60 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEzNvWfNZWQ&ab_channel=GracieBreakdown) on this.

When you get them in a [[Knee On Belly]], and they begin to post their arms out on you, you can turn away and simultaneously pin their bottom arm to the floor with your other knee.

Then, you grab their arm down, and switch the knee that is pinning it with your other knee.

The other arm will come in and try to help, and quickly weave your arm under their arm and neck to secure a shallow darce.

# Defense

Look to make your shoulders wider to make the choke weaker. From here, you can start to push the arm up and clear the arm

## Some Key Details

- To tighten the darce, you start to rotate the arm that is on their back up closer to their shoulders.
