The shoulder lock submission. One of the first submissions you learn. Simple, yet effective.

# Submission Details

From a top position, you can take a two on one grip on either arm, and drive the arm down to the floor to isolate it.

When shooting for an Americana, you want to monkey grip the hand, and also frame your elbow against their head so they can't turn towards you.

You can cover their arm with your head and shoulder to prevent their other hand from coming to rescue their isolated arm.

When going for the sub, you lean one way a lot. You can hook one leg on the other side to prevent them from pushing you off that way. 

Another thing you can do is to get a cross face and have a grip on their arm with your crossface arm, and do the Americana from there.

To finish, paint their wrist on the floor downwards for an external rotation of the shoulder cuff.

# Common Sub Positions

- [[Mount]]
- [[Side Control]]
- [[Half Guard Top]]
- [[Closed Guard (Top)]] if you're a menace

# Defenses

Try straightening your arm out all the way. What this does is it forces the opponent to overextend and lean heavily one way when going for the sub, and you can start to bridge them off to create space, and maybe even start climbing their back.

If there is space, you can reach with the other arm and crank to prevent the sub. This does expose your back, however, so use this with caution, or knowing you'll most likely get your back taken.
