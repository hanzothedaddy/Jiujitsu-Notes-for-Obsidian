Ezekiel chokes are a solid attack on the upper body that forces the opponent to react to your attack, and if they do not respect the attack attempts, you can get some solid submissions with. Threatening the Ezekiel and forcing the opponent to react and defend your Ezekiel attempts opens you up for further advancements of positions and attacks.

# Common Choke Positions

- [[Mount]]
- Bottomside [[Mount]]
- [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]]
- [[Half Guard Top]]
- [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- Closed Guard (Top) if you're Craig Jones lol
- [[Gift Wrap]] position, you can sneak your other hand in the crevice of their shoulder and neck to get a Gift Wrap Ezekiel choke.

## Choke Details

For the Ezekiel, you need a very deep crossface arm from the position you are in. From the crossface, you want to sneak your hand in from the other side and place your forearm as deep across as possible, then squeezing up.

### Troubleshooting

Often times, if the opponent sees the Ezekiel attempt, they will push their hands up to block their neck.

## Forcing the Dilemma

Craig Jones and (the really solid gi grappler) both explain that they attempt Ezekiel chokes to compromise their position.

If the opponent does not react to the Ezekiel in time to stop it, you can sink in the choke and get a tap. If you sink in the choke, the opponent can sweep you and such, but the choke will still be applying, and you'll get a tap eventually.

The opponent will often times react to the Ezekiel by bringing their hand up to their neck or block your hand from coming in. You can use this opportunity to climb up in positions like [[Mount]] for a better position like the S-mount.

## Defenses

### Early Prevention

To prevent an Ezekiel from happening early, you can prevent the crossface arm from coming in if possible. Do your best to prevent the opponent from controlling your head.
