In my opinion, the strongest submission and the most fundamental. If I ever find myself not submitting people, I fall back on perfecting the armbar.

The armbar position is also a very strong control position, and it's a good indication that you have proper technique when you can hold them down for a few seconds with it.

### Getting Stacked?
- I found that finishing an armbar from [[Mount]], I would get stacked a lot. The most important thing I found for not getting stacked is to sit on their chest when transitioning to finishing the armbar. I would sit off the side, and it would give them space to stand up and stack.
- If you hold their close leg when finishing the armbar, it prevents them from standing up and stacking your armbar.
- Pinch your legs very tightly around the arm!
- If it is not too late, you can invert underneath the stack to relieve pressure and sweep them.
- The leg that clamps their head is the most important leg. Clamp it so they can't stand

### Finishing Detail Ideas

If they cross their arms to defend, you can push the far bicep with your feet to break.

Remember that the lever of the arm is strongest at the hand and wrist, so pull there, not on bicep.

If you can't break their defending grip, you can weave your legs through and catch a [[Triangle]] instead.

If they start to stand up, or you feel the arm is not trapped in the right angle, you can always transition to an [[Omoplata]] .

Another way to transition this armbar when they are defending is to first, start with your arm deep between their arm. Then, wrap the leg closest to their head around their arm, lock your legs in a triangle for a [[Bicep Slicer]] finish.

If they start to stand up while their arms are weaved to try to stack you, you can transition into a [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]] [[Baratoplata]] . Key is to put your foot on their hips so you can push.

# Finishing Positions

You can hit the armbar from virtually anywhere, but some main ones are:

[[Closed Guard (Bottom)]]
This is the classic armbar that you are taught when you start Jiujitsu. However, just because it is a basic technique does not mean it is not effective.

Control their wrists, then unlock your closed guard and push off their hip with one foot to create an angle. Closely and swiftly bring your foot over their head and trap both their arms with your legs and shoot your hips up to finish this armbar.

[[Mount]] 
Just remember to sit on the chest in the transition. You can grab both their pushing hands too

[[Half Guard Bottom]] / [[Half Butterfly Guard]]
From a Z-guard or butterfly half guard, you can clinch the far crossface arm and attack a choi bar.

[[Side Control]]
From a [[Knee On Belly]], you can hit a close arm or far arm armbar when they push off.

[[Back Mount]]
From the triple threat series. If you are in the weakside, grab the close arm, chop their neck away and hit armbar there.
