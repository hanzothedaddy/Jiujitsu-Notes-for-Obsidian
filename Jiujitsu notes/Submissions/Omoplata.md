The omoplata is a fantastic controlling position with a lot of entries in and transitions out. Its hard to submit with the omoplata, but it's doable and it's important to learn it as well.

# Common Entries

- [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]]
- [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- Transitioning from [[Triangle]]
- [[Mount]] via rolling Omoplata

# Submission Details

The Omoplata is basically a Kimura but with your legs, meaning it's a finish by rotating their shoulder cuff backwards.

If you would like to finish an Omoplata, the best chances to do so would be to get an opponent flat on their belly. To do so, first control their arm between your legs and do a "proper lady" pose with your legs, meaning you prop your feet to the outside to pressure in with your body.

It's important to get a grip over their back when going for an Omoplata, because this prevents your opponent from rolling out of the Omoplata to escape it.

To get your opponent belly down, control their arm, and start to scoot your butt in a circle motion TOWARDS them. This forces your weight over them and collapses them over their post. From here, it's a matter of posting your hips out and submitting them.

# Transitions

Omoplata attempts are great for control, and also to transition into other positions and submissions.

When an opponent attempts to roll out of your Omoplata, you can catch their side of the roll with your free leg and transition into an [[Armbar]]. Since the roll is a very common defense, be ready to transition into the Armbar if you see it coming.

Another transition after getting a grip around their back with your arm is to let go of the Omoplata and start to take [[Back Mount]]. 

# Defense

The most common defense is to roll forward with the pressure to avoid the Omoplata. The opponent will get a chance to follow through to finish an [[Armbar]] after the rolling attempt, so you will have to be ready for that.

In No-Gi, it's possible to be able to limp arm out of the Omoplata if the grips and connections are not strongly established.
