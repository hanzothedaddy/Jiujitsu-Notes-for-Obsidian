# Fundamentals of Mount



# How do I Hold Mount?

One of the hardest things that I deal with In BJJ, since I am 135lb, I can't hold a decent mount position. I feel like I don't have much of control whenever I am.

The very beginning of this[ video from Rener Gracie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oLm1YNIB-o&t=197s&ab_channel=MagnusMidtb%C3%B8) has some very fundamental concepts of holding a good mount.

There are a couple of concepts that I found useful when trying to hold mount. One of the things was to **grapevine** my legs through theirs to prevent the bench press. After grapevining, you need to lift up your legs and exert pressure downwards with your hips as shown in that video. If I can get a **cross face** and grapevines, I am unbenchpressable, but I can still get rolled to either side.

When you feel a roll to either side, you can let go of one of your hooks and base with your knee to the side they try to roll you to.

A technique I saw was a sort of side mount or modified mount that involves shifting your weight slightly to the left or right of a mount.

# Transitions

- [[Back Mount]]: You can get to the back if their arms ever cross the center line. As soon as they cross over, climb up the mount and wedge your knee behind their back. Get a seatbelt grip, or a Kimura grip on their far arm, lift them up 

Mount Tips

-   First, you have to get your hips off the opponent’s power line, which is represented by their hips. Simply put, sit above the opponent’s belt rather than on it, or worse, below it. This will ensure that you won’t go flying even if they buck up with all their power.   
    
-   Second, you need to make somebody weak, so you can control them more easily and set up attacks at will. The easiest way to achieve this is to get both the opponent’s elbows above to touch their ears. Even if you get this on one side, you’ll weaken them significantly, but having both arms high above their head means they can’t do anything with them.   
    Throw in a bend of the head in any direction, and you also achieve a very easy posture break that further weakens the person on the bottom.   
    
-   The final piece of the puzzle is weight. You need to relax completely, to be as heavy as humanly possible when on top of somebody. Think about how lifting a 150 lbs barbell feels vs. lifting a 150 lbs water balloon. Exactly. Concentrated weight is easier to lift than free-shifting weight. When you relax on top of someone, you achieve the latter.
