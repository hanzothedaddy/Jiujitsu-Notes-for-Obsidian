Mount escaping is very heavily dependent on timing, direction, setup, and a very solid bridge up.

To understand mount escaping, we need to realize what it is that the opponents want, and what our response should be to that.

The opponent will most likely want to climb up higher on your mount to secure it further for attacks. The first thing we want to do is t-rex arms to prevent submissions, and the second is to post on their hips to prevent them from moving up. You can do this with a combination of hip posting and shrimping away to drive their hips lower.

Because your bridge is your strongest tool in escaping the mount, the opponent most likely wants to kill your bridge by either grapevining around your legs, or controlling your head with a crossface. It is crucial that you recognize these and you block their hands and prevent this.

Your bridge has the strongest effect when their hips are loaded directly onto yours. This is why it's important to keep them from climbing up the mount.

Remember that with any bridge that forces your opponent to post, you have that bit of time where their pressure is off of you, and you need to capitalize on these little moments to re-position continue escaping.

## Escape to Half Guard

Once we have your opponent on your hip and you have a strong post on their hip with your hands, you can do a big bridge to one direction, and push with your hands on their hip too. This will give you some space to pummel one of your legs under their legs, and this will allow you to secure a [[Half Guard Bottom]] position. 

The classic way to escape this fully is to continue this same motion, but towards the other side, and pulling out your other leg to secure [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]].

## Bridge and Roll Escape

If you have your opponent on your hips, you can trap one of their legs with your leg, and grab a two on one grip to their hand on the same side. This prevents any posts on that side for the opponent, and you want to do a big bridge up and to that side. When you do this escape, bridge ALL the way up, basing on your neck, and roll over. This will get you on [[Closed Guard (Top)]] to play if you did it correctly.

## Hip Bump

This particular escape is very strong when they grapevine around your legs as well. You want both hands on their hips, and you do a big bump and push up. This creates space underneath them to wedge both your knees in.

Brandon's way of hip bump escaping is to post one hand on their hip, the other on the back of their tricep (assuming they have a gable grip around your face and arm), then you almost roll backwards, bumping their hips forward with your posts and your knees.

## Side Shrimp Escape

You can do a hard side shrimp by posting off their hips and pushing your own hips towards on of their legs. This gives you room to throw your top leg over their leg, and you can post that foot on their hip. The lower leg can wedge in between their legs, retaining your guard.

# Some Key Details

- If you cross your arms across the center line, it's an avenue for them to take your back. 
- T-rex arms prevent most submissions if you stay tight
- Don't post to heavily on their chest, because this gives them avenues to climb up, maybe even take an S mount, and all that jazz
- Remember that mount escapes are very timing and reaction based. Choose your mount escapes according to the position you are in, and also time them for when your opponent starts to move.
- If you bump them and they post, they are briefly putting their weight on their hands. That means there is less weight on you, which gives you space to readjust and get into a stronger position. If you can tip them, you can sweep them.
