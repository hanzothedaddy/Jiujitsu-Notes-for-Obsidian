A half guard with your outside leg wedged as a butterfly hook.

Unlike the half guard, the butterfly half guard gives you a strong frame and lifting leg that will provide many attacking opportunities if used correctly. If you lose the upper body fight, you still have a strong hook on the lower body to remove pressure, sweep, or start attacking.

A key difference between Half Butterfly Guard and [[Half Guard Bottom]] is that the half butterfly is seen as a stronger attacking opportunity position, but it allows the opponent to disengage and rotate around if the control isn't strong enough.

# Submissions Available

- Choi bar [[Armbar]] - Just like from half guard, the choi bar set up is available from getting a butterfly grip deep around their crossface arm, framing the butterfly hook leg up against their neck.

- [[Heel Hook]] - The butterfly half guard gives you access to lower half submissions, as you can start to attack their free leg.

- [[Triangle]] - you can use the overhook system and attack a triangle by pushing down on the overhook, which forces the opponent to post heavy on their hand, which allows you to shoot your hips up for a triangle attempt.

- [[Kimura]] - by attacking the far crossface arm, you can get into Kimura attacks.

## Attacking Angles

One key difference between the butterfly half and the half guard is the wedged foot between their hips that allows you to have lots of pushing and sweeping abilities. Unlike the butterfly guard, it is hard to disengage from the butterfly half at times due to the half guard leg that is hooked behind the opponent.

It is important to monitor the crossface arm, as the opponent will be looking to get a crossface and underhook to shut down your butterfly hook as much as possible. However, we do get ways of fighting back against opponent's crossface attempts due to having a pushing foot (the butterfly hook).

### Dogfight

Just like the half guard, it is easy to transition to [[Dogfight]] type of attacks.

### Attacking the Crossface Arm



### Overhook System

Often times, the opponent will be looking to get an underhook on the side of the butterfly hook in attempts to pressure pass or shut down the butterfly hook. We can establish a strong overhook around their underhooked arm apply pressure downwards for lots of opportunities to attack.

The pressure down will often cause the opponent to post with their free hand. You can grab that hand with your free hand, and get a kimura grip onto your own hand with your overhooked hand.

This will eliminate their post and allow you to do a Butterfly sweep by pushing with your butterfly hook and pulling on their post hand.

If the opponent's post hand is too far, this allows us to still apply pressure with our overhook arm and push away with our butterfly hook. This gives us space to try to shoot a [[Triangle]] , or even to start wrestling up and getting a [[Front Headlock]] position attack.
