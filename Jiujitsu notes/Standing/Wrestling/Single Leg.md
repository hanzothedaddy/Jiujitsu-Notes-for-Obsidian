"I don't want to carry his leg, I want to make him carry my weight." - Nicky Rod.

The single leg takedown is so versatile and powerful that it's achievable from almost any position, and it's a key stable takedown in all of [[Wrestling]] and Jiujitsu.

# Common Positions

To get a single leg, you can do this from any position where you have access to any of your opponent's legs. The positions that this is available in is limitless if you're creative enough. Some common positions to shoot for a single leg include:

- [[Wrestling]]
- [[Arm Drag]] and [[Russian Tie]]
- [[Collar Tie]]
- Wresting up from a bottom position guard, such as [[Shin to Shin Guard]] 

# How to shoot

When you shoot for the single, it's important to cut the angle to the outside of their leg and pick it up.

## Standard Shot

When you shoot for a single leg from standing, all you gotta do is level change, then grab the leg closest to you. 

## Sit through

Another way to shoot for their leg is to sit through between their one of their legs aggressively and come up.

For this shot, you can achieve it from a strong [[Arm Drag]] or [[Russian Tie]], and when the opponent tries to clear it, you can take that opportunity to take the shot. Andrew Wiltse has a great video on this shot details.

## Shooting from sitting

When you shoot for a single leg from a sitting position, you can start to build height from your butt to your knees. You want to do this by swiping your legs to the side, then coming up to the knees there.

# Finishing Details

When you shoot and grab their leg, it's important that we **hold their leg between your legs** so they can't pull their own leg out of your single leg attempt.

Grab a gable grip right behind their knee or thigh, then pressure down on their leg and have the opponent bear all your weight.

## Run the pipe 

## High Crotch/ High C

## Transition into another shot

You can transition from the single leg into another takedown, such as the [[Double Leg]] by grabbing their other foot if it's available, then running the pipe.

# Defenses

## Sprawl

One of the most common defenses to the Single Leg is to sprawl before they get to your legs heavy on their head. This would lead to being able to get into [[Front Headlock]] attacks.

## Standard Defense

Another common defenses once they've got your leg is to circle the leg to the outside. This lets you frame the leg on their upper thigh, and as you do this, you can throw down a heavy [[Whizzer]] on their outside arm, while maintaining pressure on them with your head. You want to make eye contact with him, as you pressure into him, not away from him.

From here, you want to control his inside wrist with your free hand. As you do that, you can find his chin with the free hand and square up with him. Form an S-grip with your hands with two overhooks on his arms, then you can break his lock.

Henry Cejudo has a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzUYQrDNm0w&ab_channel=FANATICWRESTLING) on this defense.

## Guillotine

You can cup the opponent's chin when they shoot a single leg and transition into a [[Guillotine]] choke.

## Kimura

There is a [[Kimura]] defense against the single leg.
