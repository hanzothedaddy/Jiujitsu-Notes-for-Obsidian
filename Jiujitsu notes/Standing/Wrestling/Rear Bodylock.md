Standing rear bodylock position. Lock down the position with a gable or an S-grip. It is a very advantageous position, and there are lots of ways to take someone down from here. 

# How to get here

There's a lot of ways to get to the rear bodylock. The most common is when you are [[Wrestling]] and you clear under one of their arms. You can do this through [[Arm Drag]], [[Russian Tie]], chucking their [[Collar Tie]] hand over, etc.

Another way to get here is from a scramble. Sometimes, the opponent's back is exposed, and all you have access to is their waist. Get a rear bodylock when the opponent looks to build height.

# Takedowns

## Reverse Tai Otoshi

You can hit a reverse [[Tai Otoshi]] to take someone down. I learned this from Damian from the B-Team.

Reverse Tai Otoshi is done to sit someone down from a Rear Bodylock position. Walk them forward with a rear bodylock grip, then at the last second before the throw, switch the hand grip to one side of the hip, then do a split squat, and throw them over the leg that is posted out. You should end up in a top position here.




These next few throws are a series all listed on this [video by Nicky Rod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coa9MpcPFew&ab_channel=B-TeamJiuJitsu).
## Kneeblock Forward Throw

The ==[[Rear Bodylock#^hdyv9z|kneeblock forward throw]]== starts with establishing a rear bodylock, then stepping your outside foot knee right in front of their knee. So, if you were stepping in the front with your left leg, it would block their left knee, vice versa. This lets you trip them and have them post on all four limbs. 

As you have them post, keep the knee blocking their knee, circle around to your butt and break down their posture.

As the opponent looks to regain their posture, they will turtle up, and you can start to attack the [[Turtle]] position by inserting your first hook, you can get a [[Powerhalf Nelson]] around their farside arm, break them down, expose their back into [[Back Mount]].

## Front Suplex

This front suplex begins with the same kneeblock setup listed above. You step in front of their knee, and you look to plant your feet and put your hips under theirs. You can pick them up, and *lightly* throw them forward for your partner's safety.

From here, the attack is the same as the kneeblock throw.

As the opponent looks to regain their posture, they will turtle up, and you can start to attack the [[Turtle]] position by inserting your first hook, you can get a [[Powerhalf Nelson]] around their farside arm, break them down, expose their back into [[Back Mount]].

## Double Leg

If the opponent circles too much and is starting to break your grip, you are in a fantastic position to transition into a [[Double Leg]] takedown. As they are breaking your grip, let go of your grip, drop low and pick up their legs for a double leg.
