A classic, powerful takedown.

# Common Positions

A double leg is versatile in the sense that you can shoot it from almost any position that you have access to both your opponent's legs. This includes:

- [[Wrestling]] 
- [[Collar Tie]]
- [[Arm Drag]] and [[Russian Tie]]
- Wrestling up from a bottom position
- [[Rear Bodylock]]

If you're creative enough, or looking for it more, you'll find opportunities to shoot double legs, whether it's from standing or sitting.

# How to shoot

To shoot a double leg, all you have to do is lower your level, take a penetration step to their inside space, grab onto the back of both of the opponent's knee, the posture up and drive it all the way through.

A common mistake when shooting a double leg is that they don't drive all the way through. After you get into position, you want to drive your legs all the way through until you take them down fully.

A double leg will land you in either [[Closed Guard (Top)]] or [[Side Control]], depending on how you shoot the double.

## Shooting from the side

When you shoot a double leg, you often want to cut an angle to the side of their legs, then drive them sideways rather than backwards. 

## Blast Double

A blast double is different than a standard double leg in the sense that you are cupping their legs, but you are driving your forehead into their chest and "blasting" them backwards.

This blast double is safer against [[Guillotine]] attempts from the opponent, because your forehead is right in front of their chest. However, if you're not careful, you will land in their [[Closed Guard (Top)]] or get into a scramble where you're [[Open Guard Passing]]. 

# Defenses

## Guillotine

Against a poorly shot double leg, the opponent will stick their head up right under your armpit. You can get a quick [[Guillotine]] grip around their chin, then fall into a guillotine.

## Sprawl

As any type of [[Wrestling]] shot, you can sprawl right on top of a double leg shot and stuff their shot. From the sprawl, you can attack [[Front Headlock]] attacks.
