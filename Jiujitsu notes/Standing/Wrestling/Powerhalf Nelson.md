Control position mainly from [[Back Mount]] and [[Front Headlock]].

This grip involves one of your arms weaved under the opponent's arm, then over the back of their neck, palm facing down. You can do this from the front, or back, of [[Turtle]]. 

You can secure this grip by gable gripping your hands and exerting a lot more pressure down on their arm and their neck for a lot of controlling opportunities.
