The most common wrestling tie up. Mastering this position and the goals of this collar tie would give you the fundamentals you need to get better at [[Wrestling]].

# Understanding the Position

The basic collar tie position is achieved by grabbing the back of the opponent's head with one arm. Then, tuck your elbow to the inside of the opponent's chest, placing your forearm deep on the side of their neck.

This basic collar tie position does a few things for us: one, it **gives us great control of their head, and if you control their head, you can control where the opponent goes.** 
Two, the forearm in by their neck creates a frame and a layer of defense to prevent the opponent from pushing in towards you.

This basic collar tie leaves you with one of your arms free for other things, such as grabbing their wrist, or grabbing their chin, grabbing their tricep, etc.

From this point, the opponent's idea would be to clear the tie, and there will be ideas on clear the ties listed later on this note.

# Ways to Advance the position

There are many ways to advance the position with a collar tie. Keep in mind, there are many more ways of attack the collar tie, but here are some main offensive lines.

## Outside Step

After achieving a strong collar tie, you can take a strong step to their outside leg with your front leg, and put your collar tie to your back pocket, then your freehand can attack the front leg. From here, you can cut the angle across and attack a [[Single Leg]] or [[Double Leg]] takedown. [Video on it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7X48_clsTA&ab_channel=RUDIS).

## Snapdown

You can hit a very strong [[Snapdown]] from a collar tie, then you can establish a chin strap grip. You can step back, drive your hips to the ground to start attack [[Front Headlock]] attacks, or you can use the free hand to reach for their leg and attack a [[Single Leg]] or a [[Double Leg]] takedown.

## Ankle Pick

You can hit an [[Ankle Pick]] from the collar tie. You can circle around, pulling the head, and as you step the circle and pivot towards your collar tie side, you clear your own tie, push on their own collar tie, pick the far side ankle, and get the takedown.

## Shooting

Not only can you hit an [[Ankle Pick]], but you can duck under and take a shot. You can duck under for a [[Double Leg]], [[Single Leg]], or even a [[Fireman Carry]] takedown as well.

# Clearing the Collar Tie

Often times, the opponent will get a collar tie on you first, or you will both establish a collar tie on each other. It is important to understand clearing the tie to advance your own position while compromising theirs. Lots of ways to clear the collar ties are shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/0Aom5YFWeOY), and it's great drills as well.

## Arm Chuck

The simplest grip, and the most intuitive grip, you can get on a collar tie is a forearm grip from the top. You chuck of their collar tie arm by pushing down on their forearm with your wrist as it reaches your neck.

This arm chuck motion is important as it lets you get an [[Arm Drag]] with the freehand on the back of their tricep of the collar tie arm and establish an [[Arm Drag]] position.

## Slip

You can slip underneath their collar tie arm by establishing a tricep grip with the same side arm. You can duck under the collar tie arm, push the collar tie arm up, and slip under it. This can set you up for some shots as well, or you can establish a [[Rear Bodylock]] as well.

## Circle Clearing the Head

To clear the tie this way, you can circle our same side arm on the inside of the collar tie arm by coming under the arm and pushing away. First, grab their neck area with the free arm, then circle the hand on their collar tie side to the inside. From the inside, you can wrap that arm around and establish a tricep grip from the inside. As you do that, capture a collar tie of your own. It should be a hard chop on their neck and inside tricep at the same time to the same way.

## Inside Elbow Throw By

The throw by clear is done by getting a collar tie of your own, and resting your free hand on top of their own collar tie. 

First, set up the clear with a hard pull. Then, the free hand reaches really deep inside their collar tie arm. Your **own elbow should come UP**, not down. As you reach inside the arm, you step your leg to the outside of their own collar tie, look behind you and chuck past their collar tie arm with your free hand's arm and shoulder. [Video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNzu-_KexuI&ab_channel=CaryKolat)

From this inside elbow throw position, not only will you clear the position, but you should have an arm wrapped a round their neck and their own arm. This is a good position to drag them down to the mat to a [[Turtle]] position, or if they posture up, you can go for a strong head and arm grip and do a [[Osoto Gari]] throw.
