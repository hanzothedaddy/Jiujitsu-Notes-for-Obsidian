# Throw Details

## Regular Osoto Gari

The Osoto Gari has beauty in it's simplicity and effectiveness. A lot of Osoto Gari setups involve you **off balancing the opposite side** to give you the position to do attempt the throw.

For example, you can hold a high underhook by rolling your wrist up and driving forward help you set up the throw.

In this above example, Shintaro Higashi explains that with this underhook, the opponent is basing too far back to attempt an Osoto Gari. He explains that it is better to go for an inside leg attack, such as the [[Uchimata]], [[Ogoshi]] or [[Harai Goshi]].

In this above example, Shintaro Higashi has a high underhook and drives in with his head, giving him a better position to attempt this Osoto Gari.
## Head and Arm Osoto Gari

The head and arm Osoto Gari is a variation of the Osoto Gari that can go straight into an [[Arm Triangle]] choke if done correctly.

You can duck under a [[Collar Tie]] and pull them with your own collar tie, then step behind them as you perform the Osoto Gari.
