# Throw Details

## Regular Tai Otoshi

The Tai Otoshi is super similar to the [[Harai Goshi]] in my opinion. You have the same grips, and it's a similar looking throw. However, the difference is that the Tai Otoshi relies on you sticking out your leg as a post over their outside leg to throw them over it.

If you do this throw with a 2 on 1 grip, the opponent can easily post their other arm freely on the floor to prevent the throw. From here, you can transition into a [[Yoko Otoshi]] by dropping onto your hips, sticking out your foot, then dragging them over.

## Reverse Tai Otoshi

Reverse Tai Otoshi is done to sit someone down from a [[Rear Bodylock]] position. Walk them forward with a rear bodylock grip, then at the last second before the throw, switch the hand grip to one side of the hip, then do a split squat, and throw them over the leg that is posted out. You should end up in a top position here.
