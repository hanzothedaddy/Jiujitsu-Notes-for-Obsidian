Glossary of Judo throws, as well as general concepts. Keep in mind, most of these Judo throws will have a No-Gi focus.

# Judo Throw Glossary

- [[De Ashi Harai]] - Advancing foot sweep. On the leg that has no weight.
- [[Harai Goshi]] - Hip sweep. Throwing them over your hips, then lift your legs like an Uchimata, but sweeping both legs instead of one.
- [[Kata Guruma]] - Shoulder wheel. With a 2 on 1 grip on the arm, you can roll them over their own shoulder, like you force them to do a forward roll over you. This is the Judo version of a Fireman Carry throw.
- [[Koshi Guruma]] - Headlock throw. It's a hip throw, your hand is around their neck, like a headlock.
- [[Kosoto Gari]] - Small outer reap. It's like De Ashi Harai, but on the foot that is planted on the ground.
- [[Kouchi Gari]] - Small inner reap. You scoop the inside leg to trip them in.
- [[Osoto Gari]] - Large outer reap. It's the step behind their leg and trip takedown.
- [[Ogoshi]] - Large hip throw. Step in like a Harai Goshi, and throw over the hip.
-  [[Ouchi Gari]] - Large inner reap. Instead of stepping behind them for the Osoto Gari, you step inside their leg and trip their inside leg.

- [[Tai Otoshi]] - Body drop. You extend your leg out to throw them over it, either from the front, or from the back.
- [[Uchimata]] - Inner thigh reaping throw. You take your leg between theirs and throw them over.
- [[Tani Otoshi]] - Valley drop. You step behind both their legs with your inside leg, and you trip them over it, often falling with them.

# General Judo Ideas

- Like BJJ, there is a push and pull concept in Judo too. You want to push in a direction to get them to react the other way, then you immediate start pulling that way.
- Wresting and Judo can be integrated together very well once you understand the requirements you need to get certain throws
- Make sure you practice chain judo throws, which means to have another throw ready when you fail another
