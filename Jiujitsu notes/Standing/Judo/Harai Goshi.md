# Throw Details

With the grips needed, take a backstep towards their hip, then you can block their far leg with your own leg. Sweep the leg up, then hit the Harai Goshi. 

This throw and [[Uchimata]] are very similar, as you need similar grips and a big backswing of your leg to make this throw work. The only difference is that the Uchimata is on the inside leg thigh, while the Harai Goshi is on the outside leg.

If you miss an [[Uchimata]] attempt, it's most likely because the opponent frees their leg up and steps back. You can go into your Harai Goshi throw.

Sometimes, the opponent will drop their hips low to prevent the Harai Goshi throw. In this case, you can throw the underhook arm over their head, and go for a opposite corner [[Ankle Pick]] or a [[Kouchi Gari]]. From here, if they posture, you can swing under the underhook arm and get a rear body lock.
