- From an over-under situation, when your opponent is [fishing hard for double unders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJWvgdZNUAU&ab_channel=ShintaroHigashi)
- Countering a body lock
- From a [[Collar Tie]] , you can do this by[ releasing the collar hand briefly to throw](https://youtu.be/GuVslx1V934)

Shintaro Higashi explains that this throw is mostly done as a bait and setup throw.

# Throw Details

Couple ways to do this throw. There's the wrestling way, and the Judo way to do the throw. Both ways though require a big overswing of your shoulder. Shoulder-to-face.

## Judo Way

The Judo way of doing this throw is to get the tricep grip and the arm around the head, then you step back and turn around away from the opponent, while getting your hips underneath theirs. Elevate their hips onto yours, carry it through, and you should land in a scarf hold [[Side Control]].

## Wrestling Way

The [[Wrestling]] way to do this throw is a "sag headlock" Koshi Guruma, where you keep the legs a little far, then start to throw your hip in, but you kinda sag and drag them to the ground with you. As you sag, you start to walk them through in a circle until they fall. You should again, land in a scarf hold [[Side Control]].
