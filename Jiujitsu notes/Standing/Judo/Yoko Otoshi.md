# Throw Details

This throw requires you to commit and lay down completely as you do the throw. With the grips needed, you want to step in with your far leg, do a split squat, and start to lay down while throwing them over their own shoulder.

This version above shows a throw with the over under grip. It is easier to do if the opponent is leaning more into you to avoid any other throw.

This version above is from an overhook grip, for when your opponent is expecting an [[Uchimata]] or [[Harai Goshi]] type of throw, they are basing far back. Then, you can go for the Yoko Otoshi.

This version above is when the opponent gets a favorable double under grip on you. You can grab a double overhook grip and go for a Yoko Otoshi throw.
