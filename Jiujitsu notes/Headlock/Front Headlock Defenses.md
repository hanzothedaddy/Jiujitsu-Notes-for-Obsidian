# General Defense

A general gameplan for defending against headlock attacks, whether it's a guillotine, darce, anaconda, etc. Is to start by grabbing the tricep of their choking arm with the same arm (opposite side arm) and pulling on it. This is kinda unintuitive, but it loosens the choke because it extends their arm, which creates a gap in the choke.

From here, you want to start to rotate your head to the inside, towards the wrist of the choking hand. 

As you do this, start driving your knee up the same side of their choking arm to create height and leverage.

Take the same side arm and place it on their back, as you start to peel off the choke. From this position, you're in good position to start to take [[Back Mount]] if you peel off the choke properly.



Another general defense gameplan is not accept the Front Headlock position passively. Always drive back into the front headlock and pressure the opponent to control you, and make them make a mistake.
