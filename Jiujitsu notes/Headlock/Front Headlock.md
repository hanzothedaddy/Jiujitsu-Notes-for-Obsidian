If they end up trying to step up to build height, you can [[Ankle Pick]] the leg that's building up, and chuck their head over that leg.

## Control Ideas from the Headlock

- Try to sprawl out as much as you can and drive your hips to the mat
- Don't forget that you have a lot of freedom to move around if you control their head
- Pull backwards to offbalance them when they are trying to break out
- Focus on tucking in the arm that you have in the headlock
- Getting a chinstrap: a good chinstrap, you retract your elbow and turn their head. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR28BqtFNrg&ab_channel=BJJFanatics)
