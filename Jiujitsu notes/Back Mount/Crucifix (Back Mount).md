# Entries


One entry I've seen to the crucifix is from a [[Kimura]] trap from side control. You kimura the opposite hand, jump over and swing all the way around over their head into their back, then wrap your legs around the other arm.

Another entry is from the [[Turtle]] position: you can get a [[Powerhalf Nelson]] on one of the arms, then wrap your legs around their other arm, and break them down this way.


# Defenses

Defending a crucifix position is a tough ordeal, but Nicky Ryan does a great job of breaking down the necessary steps to get out of the position.

Since both your hands are stuck, the escape always involves getting one of your hands free so it can help you get out of the position. Nicky Ryan likes to ==[[Crucifix (Back Mount)#^wzfevf|shrimp out and step a leg over the arm that is trapped between the legs to open up the space]]== to let his hand free, leading to a T-kimura situation.

From the T-kimura situation, Nicky Ryan ==[[Crucifix (Back Mount)#^ac0ai7|uses the free hand to push hard on the Kimura hand while extending his arm]]==, then looks to gain height.
