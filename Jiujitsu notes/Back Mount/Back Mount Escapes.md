These are a few back mount escapes, and principles to escaping the back that would help in theorizing your escape from this position.

# Key Details and Ideas

- Your opponent cannot secure your back mount if your back is physically on the floor. Due to this, you can **"peel" your back** towards to floor, as if you are trying to get some sticky gum off your back. 
- Watch out for the choking arm if it's a threat: this is only not a threat if you are in the middle of escaping the back, and their position is not secure.
- In the backmount, the **bottom hook** is the most important hook in maintaining the back. You can anchor down hard on the leg to neutralize the hook when escaping.
- The backmount escape is commonly done by going back towards [[Half Guard Bottom]]. Because of this, if you are going into Halfguard, be prepared preemptively to secure a coyote hook to go into [[Dogfight]] to fight out as soon as you escape.
- Another common escape is through [[Escaping the Turtle]]. If you can get into turtle while they are trying to take your back, you can shake off their hooks and [[Granby Roll]] out forward by posting heavily to your head side.
- Whoever controls the floor in the back mount wins a majority of the fight. You should aim to get your head to hit the floor aggresively as soon as you get your back taken, and pressure hard towards your head/shoulder side.
- You can get a 2 on 1 control on your opponent's choking arm and try to shrug your shoulders and push up on the arm to pop your head out from underneath their choking arm. A very unintuitive motion for this is to LOOK UP when you escape: this prevents your own chin from hooking onto their choking arm, and allows you to slip out of the choke if done correctly.
- If your opponent crosses their ankles in between your legs, you can triangle over their ankles and  ankle lock them.

## Arm Over Escape

The arm over escape is done by getting a 2 on 1 control on the opponent's choking arm, then pushing it up over you and getting it on the other side of your neck.
