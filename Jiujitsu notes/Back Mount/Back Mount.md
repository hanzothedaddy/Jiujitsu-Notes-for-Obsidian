The arguably strongest position in BJJ. 

# Controlling the Back

There's a variety of grips and leg configurations to control the back.

## Classic Seatbelt and Hooks

This is the classic way of controlling the back. You can insert two hooks right under the opponent's legs, which an over-under grip right behind their back. You want to stick very close and tight to them, like a backpack. As long as your *chest to back connection* is strong, you can keep very good control on them.

Your **bottom hook** is the most important for control, and you can even lock a triangle configuration around their bottom leg if that's all you can get.

Alternatively, you can weave your top hook from the backside of their leg, and control them that way as well.

## Body Triangle

I can't Body Triangle for shit cause I'm too short, but if you can, get a body triangle on them. Not only can you use this as a submission, as it squeezes on their gut, you can use it for great control. You can let go of your hands even and stick to them strongly.

If you trap an arm and lock a body triangle, it would be almost impossible for them to pull the arm out, but it's hard to get.

## Power Half Nelson Control

A lot of times, when scrambling from positions like [[Turtle]] or [[Front Headlock]], you will end up in with a [[Powerhalf Nelson]] under their arms. In cases like this, you can start inserting your hooks while controlling one of their arms and posturing their head down.

Because of the nature of this position and control over their head, you can disengage easily with pressure on their head to transition back into [[Front Headlock]] positions.

Since you have a power half nelson grip, it's also ideal for [[Armbar]] attacks.

## Straightjacket Control

The straightjacket control is when you have both hands gripping the wrists of the opposite wrists. This gives you great opportunities for you to throw your leg over their arms and trap them under your legs.

## Foot on Hip Wedge Control

This is a control method for when you are on the underhook side. You can wedge your top hook on their top hip, then your bottom hook can be wrapped around their hip or torso. This way, you can push off their hip and start to move around from here. Just like the straightjacket control, it's great angles for throwing your leg up to trap their arms. This is a great position to start threatening rear [[Triangle]], and the attacks available in the Gracie triple threat attack system.

# Over or Under Side?

Falling on overhook side gives us [[Rear Naked Choke]] but thats about it.

Falling on the underhook side gives us the [triple threat Gracie attack system](https://youtu.be/_sH9ZYN84cc): one handed [[Rear Naked Choke]], [[Armbar]], then rear [[Triangle]]. When you are on the under side, its important that you control the ground: you want to be the ground underneath them. Your head should hit the floor before theirs does.

# Pathways to the Back

There's a lot of paths to the back, but there's one concept to keep in mind to find more ways to their back. The only thing that keeps you from finding your way to the opponent's back is their **arms**. This means that in any position where you've passed their arms, you can stick very close to the arm that you've passed, and this lets you throw a big latch onto the other side of their back. Then, you can begin climbing.

Some common positions to get the back include:

- [[Arm Drag]] from any position: you clear their arm and you can start climbing.
- [[Closed Guard (Bottom)]]: if you lock up a closed guard from the side, or you swing past under their arm, latch that arm up on their lats, disengage your closed guard, and climb it.
- [[Octopus Guard]]: since you naturally swing past their arm, you can attempt to climb their back by sticking close to their upper back so they can't regain a crossface opportunity.
- [[Mount]]: one of the main things you shouldn't do in bottom of mount is to cross the center line with your arms. This is because you are clearing the arms for the top player by doing so. Once the bottom player crosses over, the top player can start to push their arms across the body and place a wedge with their knees on their upper back. Then, with a chair sit, you can get your back taken. [Chair sit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbp9v1PMnQ4&ab_channel=BrandonMccaghren) 

  Another way to take their back is with a [[Berimbolo]] style roll with your legs weaved around their legs. This can be done from an [[Open Guard Passing]] position, or [[Half Guard Top]], or even [[Mount]].
- [[Turtle]]: you can insert both hooks from top of turtle, their grab a seatbelt over-under hook grip around them, or even a [[Powerhalf Nelson]] grip around one of their arms, and you pull up to break them back down.

  From Turtle, it's also possible to weave your legs around their other arm and transition into [[Crucifix (Back Mount)]]. 
- Standing: whenever you can clear under one of their arms, whether swing under it, or you [[Arm Drag]] past it, you can lock a [[Rear Bodylock]], take them down, then secure the back.

This is some of the many ways to scramble to their back. Get creative!

## Rear Mount

Trouble with handfighting from the back? You can negate the handfight by forcing them belly down. This position is called the "Rear Mount", which is basically a top mount, but with the opponent facing down. You can get to this position steadily through the concepts of [[Power Pins]], and this position is considered the strongest position in Jiujitsu.
