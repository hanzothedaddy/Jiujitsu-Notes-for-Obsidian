# Jiujitsu Notes For Obsidian

This is a project that was mainly started to help myself understand and connect all the various positions and submissions in Jiujitsu.

## Installation Guide

These notes are configured to work in Obsidian.

1. Install the ZIP code for main
2. Install Obsidian
3. Open the main folder as The Vault

## Other

These notes are nowhere near finished. However, due to popular demand, I figured I would release a partially done set of notes with the rest of the sections configured so I can help anyone else at least use what I have and build upon what they find interesting for themselves.

I most likely will be updating these notes as I go, but please feel free to download it and do whatever you would like with it. Thank you!
